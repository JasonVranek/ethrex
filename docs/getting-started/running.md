# Running a node

This guide will help you start a local L1+L2 stack using ethrex.

## Starting the L1

After [installing ethrex](./installing.md), you can start a local L1 by running:

```sh
ethrex --dev
```

> [!TIP]
> In case you want to start a new L1, you can remove the data of the old one by executing:
>
> ```sh
> ethrex removedb
> ```
